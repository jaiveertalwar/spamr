Welcome to Spamr! To get started, make sure you're on a Mac running MacOS Catalina or newer. Next, download the latest release from GitHub: https://github.com/jaiveertalwar/spamr/releases.

Once you download the .pkg file, right click it, and press open. It will then ask you if you're sure that you want to open it, to which, you'll need to press 'Open'. Once it opens the installer, complete the dialog. Once you've installed the software sucessfully, open the app. You can find it in your launchpad or in spotlight search. Once it's launched, you'll need to initiate the application by sending a demo spam. This is so that we can give the app all the permissions it needs to work. Type any message in the message to be spammed box, and in the number, enter 1. Then press 'Spam'. The button will go blue, and a MacOS security prompt will show up, asking you to give Spamr accessibility control. This will allow Spamr to send the messages. You need to press 'Open System Prefrences', then the lock in the bottom left of settings. Now, in the list of apps, find Spamr, and check the checkbox. Press the lock again and your done!
