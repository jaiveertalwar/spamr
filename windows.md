Spamr does not yet have an official app for Windows (one is coming soon). If you still want to use the software on Windows, you'll need to run the terminal version of the software through Python. First, you'll need to download, and run Python 3.7-3.10 (https://python.org).
Then, download a Python editor. Once you've opened it, paste this code in: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jaiveertalwar/b5f89b0007e67db0d83b39d5e9b3de37/raw/7961cc5528b5846fb5c8e7d5e561baa8d83608de/spamr.py

Once you have the code, run these commands in terminal.

Run the Python script. That's all! Enjoy Spamr.
